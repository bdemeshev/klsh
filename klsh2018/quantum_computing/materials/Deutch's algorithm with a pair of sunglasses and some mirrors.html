<pre>Deutch's algorithm with a pair of sunglasses and some mirrors

Mike Stay, 2004

1.  Introduction

The simplest quantum system is the quantum bit, or qubit.  It's also
about the only quantum system that scales well enough that you can
play with it in your living room; in fact, it's likely that you have
the necessary materials strapped to your wrist right now.  I'm
talking about polarised light, and every digital watch, calculator,
or other LCD device has a polarising film coating it.  If you want
to gain an intuition for the way quantum systems work, there is
nothing better than playing with polarised light.  You can order
large polarised sheets from most science catalogs like Edmund's
Scientific, or you can go buy a pair of polarised sunglasses or some
cheap digital watches and cannibalize them.

Polarisers are to light like a picket fence is to a wave on a rope.
You can make a wave on a rope take nearly any shape you want: the
wave could wiggle sideways, or up and down, or diagonally, or even be
shaped like a corkscrew as it travels down the rope.  The direction
the wave wiggles with respect to the rope is called its polarisation.
If you string the rope through a picket fence, only the part of the
wave that wiggles in the same direction as the slot gets through to
the other side.  The rest of the wave is absorbed by the fence and
changed to heat.

The thing that makes quantum computers more powerful than classical
ones is the effect we just saw in this example.  Instead of having
zero and one be opposites, like positive and negative, they are
orthogonal.  They are at right angles to each other, like up-down
versus left-right; the difference between absorbed and transmitted
is 90 degrees.  It lets us take diagonal to mean "both zero and one
at the same time" and do computations in parallel.

2. Some trivial maths

The very first quantum algorithm that showed quantum computers were
more powerful than any classical computer is called Deutch's
algorithm; it only uses one qubit, and one can implement it with two
polarisers and some mirrors.  I'll explain how below, but first let
me give some more background.

The only maths we need to describe everything in quantum computing
is complex numbers and linear algebra--matrices and vectors with
complex elements.  In fact, for two of the most important quantum
algorithms, Deutch's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, we don't even
need complex numbers.  This amounts to ignoring right- and left-
handed polarisations of light (the corkscrew-shaped waves).

When we ignore these possibilities, we get what's called a "rebit".
Formally, it's a pair of opposite points on the unit circle, a
double-headed arrow at an angle w.  The angle w is from 0 up to
(but not including) 180 degrees.  Physically, a rebit can be
represented by polarised light of the kind mentioned above.  The
angle is measured from the absorbing axis of the polariser in front
of our eyes.  The point on the circle has two coordinates (a,t)
[think "absorbed, transmitted"] given by

        a = cos w    and    t = sin w.

The amount of light that's absorbed is a^2; the amount that's
transmitted is t^2.  ("x^y" means "x to the power of y".) Since

    cos^2 w + sin^2 w = 100%,

all the light is accounted for.

For example, if we had light polarised at 120 degrees, we'd see that

    t^2 = sin^2 120 = (sqrt(3)/2)2 = 3/4 = 75%

of the light is transmitted, while

    a^2 = cos^2 120 = (-1/2)2 = 1/4 = 25%

is absorbed.

3. Deutch's algorithm

Deutch's problem was the following.  Given one of the functions
f(x) from the sets {0,1} ("constant" functions) or {x,NOT x}
("balanced" functions), figure out from which set it came by
computing the value on one input.  One bit of information is enough
to distinguish the two sets, but classically there's no way of
calculating the bit we need, since it's the XOR of two function
outputs.  With a quantum computer, we get qubits for input and
output, and we can do better.

Just as there are states "between" zero and one on a quantum
computer, there are quantum gates that don't have classical
counterparts.  One of these changes the sign of a or t.  In
classical computing, the opposite of zero is one.  In
quantum computing, the opposite of up is down, but that's
still perpendicular to left-right!  In practice, it's a
reflection in a mirror.

Two reflections in a row are the same as a rotation, so we can
replace reflections horizontally and vertically with an optional
rotation followed by an optional reflection.  Rotation of 
polarisation is done with cellophane.  Depending on what kind you
get, you may see some pretty colors when you look at it between
polarisers.  This is the polarisation equivalent of a prism--just
as a prism spreads out colors in space, some kinds of cellophane
spread out colors in polarisation.  So the first polariser fixes
the polarisation of the light, then the cellophane rotates each
color differently, and the second polariser picks out a single
polarisation and therefore a single color.

Sellotape brand adhesive tape gives (as far as I can tell) a perfect 
90 degree twist for optical frequencies.  Two layers of it give 
a 180 degree twist.  (Now, since all the rebit arrows are double-
ended, a 180 degree rotation won't make any difference no matter 
which way the rebit is pointing.  We can leave it out, and it won't 
make any difference.)

So in the quantum version, we have four boxes that do the following:

    0: No rotation, even number of reflections
    1: 180 degree rotation, even number of reflections
    x: No rotation, odd number of reflections
NOT x: 180 degree rotation, odd number of reflections

If you're familiar with matrix notation, these are

0 =&gt; | 1  0|   1 =&gt; |-1  0|   x =&gt; | 1  0|   NOT x =&gt; |-1  0|
     | 0  1|        | 0 -1|        | 0 -1|            | 0  1|
     
or, most concisely

f =&gt; |-1^f(0)         0|
     |      0   -1^f(1)|
     
If we choose a horizontal or vertical double-ended arrow, we won't
be able to tell if it was reflected: they're both symmetric
horizontally and vertically.  These rebits correspond to the
classical inputs zero and one, and as before, we gain no 
information about which function it is.  However, if we choose a 
diagonal arrow, then Bob's our uncle.

Deutch's algorithm, then, goes like this:

    1. Start with light polarised in the absorbing direction.
    2. Turn the black box so the light goes in diagonally.
    3. Shine the light that comes out of the black box through our
    polariser into our eyes.  If we don't see any light, it's a
    constant function; otherwise it's a balanced function.

4. How to make it

You can build a black box by making a device that lets you choose
an even or odd number of reflections while keeping the input and
output angles the same.  It takes three mirrors and some cardboard.

The box should look like this:

+---------------------+
|                    /
|                   /
|                  /
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|  /                 /|
| /                 / |
|/                 /  |
+   ------------------+

The mirrors in the input and output corners should swivel between 45
degrees and 67.5 degrees.  That gives two possibilities: at 45
degrees, we get light entering one port, bouncing to the mirror in
the near corner, then to the mirror in the far corner, and then out.
So at 45 degrees, the light bounces an odd number of times--a
balanced function.  At 67.5 degrees, the light takes a path shaped
like three sides of a stop sign: it enters, bounces directly to the
far mirror, and bounces out.  In this configuration, the light
bounces twice--a constant function.

If you want to use the phase rotation, make a little frame for the two 
layers of sellotape that will fit over one of the ports.  

Then with a torch and polarisers on the ports, you'll have yourself a 
tabletop quantum computer!
